# Recipe-Genie-Alexa-Skill
As part of my DevPost submission for the Amazon Alexa Beyond Voice hackathon, I incoporated APL (Amazon Presentation Language) so that recipe genie would have a visual display for alexa devices with screens. Check out the [submission](https://devpost.com/software/recipe-genie) along with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRfQhhLTsBw) demoing it! 

# What it does
Recipe Genie is an Alexa Skill that solves the problem of not knowing what to make with your leftover ingredients. 
After starting Recipe Genie, simply tell Alexa your ingredients you have at home, and be given step-by-step recipies using them!
